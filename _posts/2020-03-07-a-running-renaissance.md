## Run It

I've been running since college.

I remember logging miles in Schenley Park Pittsburgh before school and the paved pedestrian-only lanes in Southside after work once I graduated. I ran for fun, to reduce stress, to get fit, to visualize goals, and to think.

I leaped into the world of endurance sports when I registered for the Pittsburgh Half-Marathon with my friends. It taught me a lot.

Like the fact that long-term goals should be bite-sized. That way you can trick yourself into believing it's no sweat to complete 13.1 miles, a 50k race, a Half-Ironman, and whatever's next on the bucket list.

Discipline is key. For me, running the minute I got home from work was essential. If I didn't put on my running shoes right away, it woudl soon be dark, cold, and I'd be tired... You get the point.   

Listening to your body is another important lesson. Rest, stretching and proper nutrition. It's huge!

## A Running Renaissance

Running today is very different from when I started a tad more than a decade ago.

Take wireless earbuds. No cords, sound isolation, and the tunes pumping. Thank you Apple Airpods Pro!

Remember those armband phone holders? Not today! The Apple Watch makes it possible to not even bring your phone along on the run.

I'm happy with my latest running purchase, the Nike Epic React Flyknit running shoes. These shoes don't have the carbon fiber soleplate that Olympians are rocking but they're still cool. And according to Nike, they're "designed to help reduce injury and keep you on the run." So Nike says... Regardless, shoe tech has come a long way.

The nutrition game is improving. There's a nutritional supplement for everyone now. I like ClifBlocks and trail mix for cycling and e-Gels by [Crank Sports](https://www.cranksports.com/) for long runs.

Strava inspired countless athletes to become more engaged, social and addicted to their sports. If it's not on Strava it didn't happen...

If anything, you have to look good doing it. That's where [Rapha](https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US) and Lululemon come in. Athleisure is one of the hottest categories out there. In one popular retail street in San Francisco I counted 5 athleisure stores. Can you say 'bubble'?

## Forward-Looking Thoughts

Looking forward I see more improvements for the weekend warrior and casual athelete: 

- Augmented reality glasses so you can see your virtual pacer to keep you honest (and working hard)
- Sports nutrition made specifically for your body and palate
- Custom sportswear (think [ProperCloth](https://propercloth.com/) for cycling bibs)

What do you think? 

Run on!
