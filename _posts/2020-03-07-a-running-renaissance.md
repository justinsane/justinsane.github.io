## Run It

I've been running since college in Pittsburgh. 

I remember logging miles in Schenley Park before school and the paved pedestrian-only lanes in Southside after work once I graduated. I ran for fun, to reduce stress, to get fit, to visualize goals, and to think.

I leaped into the world of endurance sports when I registered for the Pittsburgh Half-Marathon with my friends. It taught me a lot.

Like the fact that long-term goals should be bite-sized. That way you can trick yourself into believing it's no sweat to complete 13.1 miles, a 50k race, a Half-Ironman, and whatever's next on the bucket list.

Discipline is key. For me, running the minute I got home from work was essential. If I didn't put on my running shoes right away, it woudl soon be dark, cold, and I'd be tired... You get the point.   

Listening to your body is another important lesson. Rest, stretching and proper nutrition. It's huge!

## A Running Renaissance

Running today is very different from when I started a tad more than a decade ago.

The biggest difference that I've noticed is wireless headphones that sound amazing. Thank you Apple Airpods Pro!

Also, I don't need to carry a huge iPhone around. I especially don't need to strap that thing to my arm. Remember those armband phone holders? Not today!

I recently purchased the new Nike Epic React Flyknit shoes. While these shoes don't have the carbon fiber soleplate that the Olympians are rocking they're still cool. In fact, according to Nike, they're "designed to help reduce injury and keep you on the run." So Nike says... Regardless, shoe tech has come a long way.

The nutrition game is improving as well. There's a nutritional supplement for everyone now. I prefer ClifBlocks and trail mix for cycling and e-Gels from [Crank Sports](https://www.cranksports.com/) for long runs.

Strava has inspired countless athletes to become more engaged, social and addicted to their sports. If it's not on Strava it didn't happen...

Above all, you have to look good doing it. That's where [Rapha](https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US) and Lululemon come in. Athleisure is one of the hottest categories out there. In fact, on a trendy retail street in San Francisco, I counted 5 athleisure stores. Can you say 'bubble'?

## Forward-Looking Thoughts

In the future, I see continued improvements for the weekend warrior or casual athlete such as: 

Augmented reality glasses so you can see your virtual pacer to keep you honest (and working hard)
Sports nutrition made specifically for your body and palate
Custom sportswear (think [ProperCloth](https://propercloth.com/) for cycling bibs)
