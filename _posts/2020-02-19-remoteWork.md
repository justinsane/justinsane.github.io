Sometimes I get 'work cabin fever'. It's the tense feeling I sometimes experience when I'm working solo. It's not an issue when I'm working around other people at a coffee shop, store, airport, office, cafe, library, etc.

Professionally I work remotely and I don’t have an office (it’s my apartment).

And I consider myself a professional coffee shop worker. Fast internet, caffeine, and sound-isolating headphones - work is getting done!

On-demand coworking communities: a big future trend.

Let me explain.

On-demand meaning pay-as-you-go. No monthly or annual membership dues. Pay for a desk by the hour or day.

I define co-working as a space with other decentralized or remote workers getting it done.

The community aspect is less defined for me but I see a future where social meet-ups, gatherings, get-togethers, dinners, etc. will be a big feature.

So here’s the scenario. I tagged along with Paige on her work event in NY. While she was working in her office I wanted to be productive. As mentioned earlier I wasn’t feeling the hotel room. The FOMO (fear of missing out) was intense… I’m not in NY very often.

I planned to work in Flatiron at an awesome coffee shop called [Devoción](https://www.devocion.com/pages/devocion-cafe-flatiron-district-new-york-ny). The only problem was that they’re too cool for wifi. I remember passing a WeWork that looked like a coworking setup so I stopped in. It turned out to be a great experience.

WeWork Now is on-demand coworking. I believe it was $6 the first half hour then 20 cents every additional minute. I opted for the full day rate, $29, which included:

fast internet
power outlets
my own desk and comfy chair the entire day
food and drink service from Bluestone Lane (ordered via WeWork Now app)

There were a few startups working there. Phone calls in the private phone booth were terrific. The space was nicely decorated and furnished.

So while my initial plan of working from a coffee shop was foiled it turned to be a great experience with WeWork Now. I don’t believe they offer the service in San Francisco, yet.

I feel like decentralized and remote work is on the rise. Will coffee shops be able to accommodate all the gig workers? Where will people work (if they also experience 'Work Cabin Fever')?

I see a future where on-demand coworking is more mainstream. I don't mean restaurants that offer workstations between meal service. Thoughtful and purposeful workstations are necessary (outlets, phone or talking areas, conference or screen sharing rooms, fast internet, comfy chairs, etc.). 

From my initial Google searches, I found quite a few startups going after this problem. Is this trend happening as a result of the rise of gig workers and decentralized workforces, physical real estate struggling and 'community'?

We shall see. In the meantime, it's time to find somewhere to work...
